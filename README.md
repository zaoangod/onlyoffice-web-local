[English](README.md) | [‰∏≠Êñá](readme.zh.md)


## ‚ú® Key Features

- üîí **Privacy-First**: All document processing happens locally in your browser, with no uploads to any server
- üìù **Multi-Format Support**: Supports DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and many other document formats
- ‚ö° **Real-Time Editing**: Provides smooth real-time document editing experience
- üöÄ **No Server Required**: Pure frontend implementation with no server-side processing needed
- üéØ **Ready to Use**: Start editing documents immediately by opening the webpage

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

This project is built on the following core technologies:

- **OnlyOffice SDK**: Provides powerful document editing capabilities
- **WebAssembly**: Implements document format conversion through x2t-wasm
- **Pure Frontend Architecture**: All functionality runs in the browser

## üìÑ Opening Remote Files

### Functionality

Automatically downloads and opens remote Office files (e.g., `.docx`, `.pptx`) via route parameters, converting them into `File` objects for further use (e.g., preview or editing).

### Usage

The page URL must include the following parameters:

- `url` (required): Remote file address
- `filename` (optional): File name; if not provided, it will attempt to auto-resolve

Example:
[00.xlsx](https://sweetwisdom.github.io/onlyoffice-web-local/#/?url=https://sweetwisdom.github.io/react-filePreview/filePreview/00.xlsx)

```
?filename=00.pptx&url=https://example.com/files/00.pptx
```

### File Name Retrieval Priority

1. Route parameter `filename`
2. Parsed from `url`
3. Extracted from response header `Content-Disposition`

If the file name cannot be retrieved, the operation will terminate with an error prompt.

## Development Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile, and Minify for Production

```sh
pnpm build
```

## Docker Support

Build a custom image named `vue-local-office` (note: the `.` at the end of the command indicates using the Dockerfile in the current directory; adjust the path as needed):

```sh
docker build -t vue-local-office .
```

Map ports and start the Docker container (8080:80 maps the container's port 80 to the host's port 8080; `local-office` is the custom container name; `vue-local-office` is the custom image name):

```sh
docker run -dp 8080:80 --name local-office vue-local-office
```

After executing the above commands, open http://localhost:8080 in a browser to preview.

## Technical Details

- Uses `x2t-wasm` as a replacement for OnlyOffice services
- Utilizes OnlyOffice WebSDK for editing (sourced from `se-office`)
